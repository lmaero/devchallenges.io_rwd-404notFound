<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](./assets/images/screenshots/screenshot.png)

Responsive web design of a 404 not found page, using semantic HTML, media queries and BEM technique. You can see the deployed page in the links above. Successfully validated with W3 HTML and CSS validators.

There's a lot to learn about CSS best practices to avoid code repetition and broken designs, but I think this was a good experience to put in practice what I've learned so far.

### Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3
